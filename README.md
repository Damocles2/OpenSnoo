# OpenSnoo
OpenSnoo is an extremely minimalist third party reddit browser that is hard coded to have the features you desire through a well-structured python script.

While non-programmers can change simple values to select options such as browsing from new or hot with it's comment put throught the code, more experienced userds can completely taylor the experience and add simple code to add new features.

When you open the app, you are greeted with the simple charm that can be felt throught al of the program's 118 lines of python. A simple piece of text to notify you to add your subreddit name and button to familiarize yourself with for later will be the first things you notice, along with a design made specifically for high resolution displays (think 1080p minimum) so that no scrolling is required.

It features all a average person needs to enjoy content without any unnecesary distractions, while also providing a blank canvas for your additions. Want to be able to see how some bots are doing while you are browsing reddit? No problem! Want to make it play the text as audio for the visually impaired, or maybe ocr to read from images if you are feeling a little adventurous? Go right ahead! With this things easy to understand and open source nature, everything is possible!
